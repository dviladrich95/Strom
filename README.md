## Overview

Strom is a free, open-source script that brings smart heating to your home. It uses weather forecasts and electricity price data to fine-tune energy use, finding a cost-effective heating schedule through convex optimization. With a smart plug, Strom quietly takes care of the details, automatically adjusting your heating to save energy. Itâ€™s a simple, clever way to make your home more efficient and eco-friendly.

## Requirements

Requires **Python 3.12.8**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Bloodwing1/Strom.git
    cd Strom
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a _config_ folder in the root project directory. This folder is your personal api keys will be saved
5. Place your electricity price and weather API keys in a "price_api_key.txt" "weather_api_Key.txt" file that you create in the _config_ folder.
6. Place your tapo account credentials in a "tapologin.env" file in the _config_ folder. The content of this .env file should look like this:

    ```env
    EMAIL=myemail@hotmail.com
    PASSWORD=myPassword12
    ```

## Usage

[Technical documentation](https://janbalanya.com/strom-docs/)

To run the main script manually:

```sh
python main.py  # python3 main.py for Mac users
```

Alternatively create [a cron job](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cron-jobs-in-linux/) or similar, that activates the main script hourly.

## Future Considerations

- Cron job installer
- Standalone executable
